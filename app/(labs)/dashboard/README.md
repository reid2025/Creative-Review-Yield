# Creative Dashboard - Phase 1 Implementation

A comprehensive Creative Dashboard for performance overview, team activity, and pipeline insights.

## Features Completed âœ“

### Phase 1 - Shell + KPIs + Trends (Mock Mode)
- **Full-width white container** matching Creative Stream layout
- **Header section** with title, subtitle, and action buttons
- **Sticky toolbar** with date range picker, channel filter, and campaign search
- **KPI tiles** showing leads, spend, CPL, CTR, and active tests with delta indicators
- **Trend charts** with leads per day and spend/CPL combined chart
- **Feature flag protection** - respects `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_CREATIVE_DASHBOARD`
- **Mock data** with realistic performance metrics and sparklines
- **Loading skeletons** for smooth UX during data loading

### Phase 2 - Breakdown Tables (Mock Mode) âœ“
- **Tabbed interface** with 3 performance breakdowns: Campaigns, Creatives, Tags
- **Campaign performance table** with spend, leads, CPL, CTR metrics and sortable columns
- **Creative performance table** with thumbnails, designer attribution, and tag badges
- **Tag performance analysis** with category badges, usage metrics, and performance visualization
- **Sortable columns** - click headers to sort by any metric (asc/desc/default)
- **Performance highlighting** - CPL anomalies highlighted in red for quick identification
- **Responsive design** - tables adapt to different screen sizes with proper overflow handling

### Key Components
- `DBPageShell` - Full-width responsive container
- `DBHeader` - Title and action buttons 
- `DBToolbar` - Sticky filters and export controls
- `DBKPIStrip` - Performance metric tiles with sparklines
- `DBTrends` - Recharts-based trend visualizations
- `DBBreakdownTables` - Tabbed performance breakdown tables with sorting

### Data Architecture
- **5 key metrics** with previous period comparison for delta calculation
- **Time series data** for 14-day trend visualization
- **Mock data generators** with realistic performance patterns
- **Anomaly detection** for CPL spikes > 20%

## How to Run

### Enable Feature Flag
```bash
# In .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_CREATIVE_DASHBOARD=true
```

### Access the Feature
Navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard`

### Mock Mode (Default)
All data is generated client-side with realistic performance patterns. No backend required.

## KPIs & Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Leads** - Total lead generation with trend indicator
2. **Spend** - Total ad spend with budget tracking
3. **CPL** (Cost Per Lead) - Efficiency metric with anomaly detection
4. **CTR** (Click-Through Rate) - Engagement performance
5. **Active Tests** - Number of running experiments

### Calculations
- CPL = Spend / max(Leads, 1)
- CTR = (Clicks / max(Impressions, 1)) Ã— 100
- CVR = (Leads / max(Clicks, 1)) Ã— 100
- Î”% = (Current - Previous) / max(Previous, 1) Ã— 100

### Trend Charts
- **Leads per Day** - Line chart showing daily lead volume
- **Spend & CPL Trend** - Combined bar (spend) + line (CPL) chart

## Next Phases (Not Implemented)

### Phase 3 - Activity Log
- Team activity feed with filters
- Real-time event tracking
- Diff visualization for changes

### Phase 4 - Lift-Up Canvas
- Drag-drop image/GIF uploads
- Team morale boosting content
- History and lightbox view

### Phase 5 - Recent Uploads & Testing Pipeline
- Latest creative uploads
- Testing status visualization
- Pipeline health metrics

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Isolated feature** - All files under `app/(labs)/dashboard/`
- **Feature flag protected** - Safe to deploy with flag OFF
- **Mock-first approach** - Works without backend dependencies
- **Creative Stream styling** - Consistent visual design
- **TypeScript throughout** - Full type safety

### File Structure
```
app/(labs)/dashboard/
â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx                    # Main route with feature flag
â”œâ”€â”€ _components/               
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DBPageShell.tsx        # Full-width container
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DBHeader.tsx           # Header section
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DBToolbar.tsx          # Sticky filters
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DBKPIStrip.tsx         # Metric tiles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DBTrends.tsx           # Chart components
â”œâ”€â”€ _lib/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DBTypes.ts             # TypeScript interfaces
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DBConstants.ts         # Configuration & options
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ DBMockData.ts          # Mock data generators
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ DBUtils.ts             # Utility functions
â””â”€â”€ README.md                  # This file
```

### Dependencies
- **Recharts** - Chart visualization library
- **shadcn/ui** - UI component primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling system
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

## Development Notes

### Mock Data Patterns
- **Realistic metrics** - Based on typical ad performance
- **Trend variations** - Natural fluctuations in daily data
- **Anomaly simulation** - Occasional CPL spikes for testing
- **Cached data** - Prevents regeneration on each render

### Performance Considerations
- **Lazy loading** - Simulated with loading states
- **Memoized components** - Optimized re-rendering
- **Responsive design** - Mobile-first approach
- **Skeleton loaders** - Smooth loading experience

### Safety Features
- **Feature flag** - Complete disable capability
- **Error boundaries** - Graceful failure handling
- **Fallback states** - When data is unavailable
- **Mock mode** - No external dependencies

## Debug Information

When running in development mode, the dashboard shows debug info including:
- Feature flag status
- Current filter state  
- Mock data loading status
- Filter parameters

The Creative Dashboard Phase 1 is complete and ready for testing! ðŸš€
