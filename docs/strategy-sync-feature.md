# Strategy Sync Feature Documentation

## Overview
The **"Analyze in Strategy Sync"** button is a powerful feature in the Creatives page that allows users to perform comparative analysis across multiple creative ads to identify patterns, trends, and optimization opportunities.

## What It Does

### Purpose
Strategy Sync is designed to help marketing teams and designers:
- **Compare Performance**: Analyze multiple creatives side-by-side to identify what's working
- **Find Patterns**: Discover common elements in top-performing ads
- **Optimize Campaigns**: Make data-driven decisions for future creative development
- **Generate Insights**: Understand which creative elements drive better results

## How It Works

### 1. Selection Requirements
- **Minimum Selection**: You must select at least **3 creatives** to enable the button
- **Why 3?**: Statistical analysis requires a minimum sample size to generate meaningful insights
- **Maximum**: No upper limit, but selecting 10-20 creatives provides optimal analysis

### 2. Selection Process
```
1. Go to Creatives page
2. Use checkboxes to select creatives you want to analyze
3. Selected count appears in blue bar: "X creatives selected"
4. Button shows: "Analyze in Strategy Sync (need 3+)" if less than 3 selected
5. Button becomes active when 3+ creatives are selected
```

### 3. What Happens When Clicked
When you click "Analyze in Strategy Sync", the system:

1. **Collects Selected Creative IDs**: Takes all the creative IDs you selected
2. **Navigates to Strategy Sync Page**: Opens `/strategy-sync?creatives=id1,id2,id3...`
3. **Loads Creative Data**: Retrieves full details of selected creatives
4. **Performs Analysis**: Runs comparative analysis across multiple dimensions

## Analysis Dimensions

- **Cost Per Click (CPC)**: Which creatives have the lowest CPC?
- **Cost Per Lead (CPL)**: Which creatives generate cheaper leads?
- **Amount Spent**: Budget allocation across creatives
- **ROI Analysis**: Return on investment for each creative

### Creative Elements Analysis
The system analyzes common patterns in:

#### Visual Elements

#### Copy Analysis

#### Campaign Attributes
- **Litigation Types**: Which legal cases perform better
- **Campaign Types**: Social media vs display vs search
- **Target Audience**: Demographics and personas
- **Time Periods**: Performance over different date ranges
